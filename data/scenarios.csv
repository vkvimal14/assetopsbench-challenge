The failure modes of Chiller 6 need to be from the list ['Compressor Overheating: Failed due to Normal wear, overheating', 'Heat Exchangers: Fans: Degraded motor or worn bearing due to Normal use', 'Evaporator Water side fouling', 'Condenser Water side fouling', 'Condenser Improper water side flow rate', 'Purge Unit Excessive purge', 'Refrigerant Operated Control Valve Failed spring']",False,
619,,"When the Liquid Refrigerant Evaporator Temperature of Chiller 6 at MAIN site drops, what failure is most likely to occur?",,"the answer should contain one or more failure modes of Chiller 6. The failure modes of Chiller 6 need to be from the list ['Compressor Overheating: Failed due to Normal wear, overheating', 'Heat Exchangers: Fans: Degraded motor or worn bearing due to Normal use', 'Evaporator Water side fouling', 'Condenser Water side fouling', 'Condenser Improper water side flow rate', 'Purge Unit Excessive purge', 'Refrigerant Operated Control Valve Failed spring']",False,
620,,"I want to build an anomaly model for identifying a chiller trip failure for MAIN chiller 6. Provide me a list of sensors that I should use, along with the temporal behavior,",,"the answer should contain how to build an anomaly model for identifying a chiller trip failure for MAIN chiller 6. The answer should include sensors that I should use, along with the temporal behavior,",False,
