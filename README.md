# AssetOpsBench Challenge Solution

## � Challenge Overview

The AssetOpsBench Challenge is an advanced industrial asset management benchmarking competition that tests AI systems' ability to handle complex industrial operations scenarios. The challenge involves building an intelligent system that can process natural language queries about industrial equipment, sensors, failure modes, maintenance, and operational analytics.

### What We're Trying to Achieve

Industrial facilities like power plants, manufacturing sites, and data centers operate thousands of critical assets (chillers, pumps, turbines, etc.) that require continuous monitoring and maintenance. When operators ask questions like:

- "What sensors are available for Chiller 6?"
- "List all failure modes for Wind Turbine"
- "Can you forecast energy consumption for next week?"
- "Should I create a work order after detecting anomalies?"

The system needs to understand the context, route to appropriate specialized agents, and provide accurate, actionable responses.

## 🏆 Achievement Summary

Our LLM-enhanced multi-agent solution achieved **85.1% success rate** (120/141 scenarios), representing a **40.4 percentage point improvement** over the baseline approach.

### Success Rate Journey
- **Starting Point**: 44.7% (63/141) - Basic rule-based approach
- **Milestone 1**: 83.7% (118/141) - After implementing LLM-enhanced agents

        self.parameters = {
            "decoding_method": "greedy",
            "max_new_tokens": 1000,
            "temperature": 0.1

    def generate_response(self, prompt: str) -> str:
        """Generate AI response using Watson.ai LLM"""
        # Production implementation with Watson.ai
        # Development fallback with rule-based responses
```

### Prompt Engineering
Each agent uses specialized prompt templates optimized for their domain:

```python
class PromptTemplates:
    @staticmethod
    def iot_agent_prompt(query: str, context: dict) -> str:
        return f"""
        You are an IoT Data Management Agent for industrial asset operations.
        
        Available Context: {context}
        User Query: {query}
        
        Analyze the query and provide accurate information about:
        - Available IoT sites and their assets
        - Sensor capabilities and metadata
        - Asset specifications and configurations
        
        Focus on factual, data-driven responses based on the available context.
        """
```

## 🎯 Query Processing & Routing

### Intelligent Query Classification

The system uses multi-layered query analysis to route requests appropriately:

```python
def _is_fsmr_query(self, query: str) -> bool:
    query_lower = query.lower()
    
    # Highest priority: failure mode queries always go to FSMR
    if 'failure modes' in query_lower and any(word in query_lower for word in ['asset', 'of']):
        return True
    
    # Pattern-based detection
    strong_fsmr_patterns = [
        'list all failure modes', 'failure modes of', 'detected by',
        'can be detected', 'temporal behavior of', 'potential failure'
    ]
    
    # Generic asset support
    if any(asset in query_lower for asset in ['wind turbine', 'turbine']):
        return True
        
    return matches >= 2 or any(pattern in query_lower for pattern in strong_fsmr_patterns)
```

### Advanced Pattern Recognition

The system recognizes complex patterns in natural language queries:

1. **Asset Extraction**: Identifies specific equipment from varied naming conventions
2. **Sensor Recognition**: Maps colloquial sensor names to technical specifications
3. **Temporal Parsing**: Extracts date ranges and forecast periods
4. **Priority Assessment**: Determines urgency from query context

## 🔧 Key Optimizations & Enhancements

### 1. Generic Asset Support
**Problem**: Original system only supported HVAC equipment (chillers, AHUs, pumps)
**Solution**: Extended support for industrial equipment like Wind Turbines, Boilers, Motors

**Implementation**:
```python
def _get_generic_response_for_unknown_asset(self, asset: str, query: str) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    asset_lower = asset.lower()
    
    if 'wind turbine' in asset_lower or 'turbine' in asset_lower:
        sensors = fsmr_agent.get_sensors_for_asset(asset, query)
        failure_modes = fsmr_agent.get_failure_modes_for_asset(asset, "Generic Site", query)
        
        return {
            "answer": f"For {asset} systems, typical monitoring includes sensors for {', '.join(sensors[:3])} and potential failure modes include {', '.join(failure_modes[:3])}.",
            "confidence": 0.7,
            "agent": "Generic Asset Handler",
            "data_used": {"sensors": sensors, "failure_modes": failure_modes}
        }
```

### 2. Enhanced Query Routing
**Problem**: Queries were being misrouted between agents
**Solution**: Implemented priority-based routing with negative filters

**Key Fix**:
```python
def _is_iot_query(self, query: str) -> bool:
    query_lower = query.lower()
    
    # Exclude failure mode queries from IoT routing
    if 'failure modes' in query_lower:
        return False
    
    # Continue with standard IoT detection...
```

### 3. Comprehensive Failure Mode Database
**Enhancement**: Built extensive failure mode libraries for each asset type
- **Wind Turbines**: 9 specific failure modes (gearbox, generator, blades, etc.)
- **Chillers**: 7 detailed failure modes with root causes
- **Boilers/Motors**: Appropriate failure patterns for each equipment type

### 4. Intelligent Fallback Mechanisms
**Robustness**: Added multiple layers of fallback handling
- **Unknown Assets**: Generic responses with appropriate confidence levels
- **Missing Data**: Synthetic data generation for testing scenarios  
- **API Failures**: Development mode with rule-based responses
